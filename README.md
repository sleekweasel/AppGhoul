Hacky Android widget that lets you create persistent launcher icons for applications you uninstall and reinstall frequently.

Probably only useful for developers.

TODO:

1. Fix out of memory error during lumpy config scrolling.
1. Is it worth curating copies of the icons?

DONE:

1. Permit editing of the Intent's URL as well as its title, for extra twiddliness.
1. Pretty!
1. Thumb for rapid scrolling in config
1. Asynchronously update the configuration list
1. Persist title and intents through reboot and reinstall of AppGhoul
1. Persist the icons
1. Long-press config item to edit the title
1. Display an appghoul selected from a list of currently installed apps
