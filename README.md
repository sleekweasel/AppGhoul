Hacky Android widget that lets you create launcher icons for applications you uninstall and reinstall frequently.

Probably only useful for developers.

TODO:
1. Thumb for rapid scrolling in config
1. Asynchronously update the configuration list
1. Is it worth curating copies of the icons?

DONE:
1. Display an appghoul selected from a list of currently installed apps
1. Persist title and intents through reboot and reinstall of AppGhoul
1. Persist the icons
1. Long-press config item to edit the title
